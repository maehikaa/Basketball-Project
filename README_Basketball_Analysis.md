# 🏀 Basketball Assignment Analysis

## 📌 Project Overview

This project explores basketball player performance data to uncover insights related to scoring trends, player efficiency, and other key game metrics. Through Python-based analysis in a Jupyter Notebook, we apply data wrangling, visualization, and statistical methods to derive meaningful observations.

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Analyze player statistics to evaluate scoring performance.
- Visualize player efficiency and contribution across games.
- Apply data-driven techniques to explore correlations and trends.
- Provide actionable insights for coaching or fan analysis.

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Python**
- **Pandas** – Data manipulation
- **Matplotlib / Seaborn** – Data visualization
- **Jupyter Notebook** – Analysis and reporting environment
